A basic example of performing a DNS lookup using Node.js.

### 3. Simple TCP Communication (`simple-tcp`)
A demonstration of TCP communication between a client and a server.

- **TCP Server**: `simple-tcp/simple-server.js`
- **TCP Client**: `simple-tcp/simple-sender.js`

### 4. Simple UDP Communication (`simple-udp`)
An example of UDP communication between a sender and a receiver.
